                            hard to code, but fear not, jesus was coding this world harder, than the game you are trying to code.

I'm an 18 years old software engineer student from Bulgaria who is extremely motivated to learn something new every single day and also to gain experience in the field of Fullstack Development.

👉 About Me

💡 How can I develop a great software that customers would love? That's the question I ask myself every single time when I have to do а project, whether it's for university or for work. In each case it has come down to creativity and experience.

🎓 At the moment, I'm a junior student at SoftUni Bulgaria. In my 1 1/2 years of education and practice, I found my personal favorite language and that is is JavaScript and its React framework. Since kid, I have was always been interested in creating whatever my mind has in it and visualizing it. That's why I want to become a Frontend Web Developer and slowly build my way up, until I reach my dream Fullstack position.

💻 As a developer I'm trying my best to create things that are unique. I use algorithms, design patterns and engineering principles to craft and mold products that the customers would love. At the same time I'm efficient and perfectionist - everything I do has to be perfect. I have to be creative to put all these pieces together.

👨‍💻 Currently, I'm unemployed but I'm looking for interships and junior positions as a Web developer to get the necessary knowledge and work experience in the field of information technologies and software development.

👑 I'm a life long learner. I would like to become a Web developer and maybe in the future, I would like to teach people some JavaScript or the MERN stack. I'm a quick learner and I'm trying to work as fast as I can. I'm also a self-learner - sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to do some simple projects to maintain and eventually improve my skills.
